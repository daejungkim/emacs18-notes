This is a collection of notes on various topics of my interest such as emacs,
python, etc.

I share this hoping to benefit my friends and colleagues to learn and benefit
from these wonderful tools.

*Documents*

- [[file:emacs.org][emacs.org]] was uploaded to github in April 2016 by cutting and pasting from my old notes.
  I plan on adding many other sections over the next few months.

- [[file:emacs.html][emacs.html]] was generated from [[file:emacs.org][emacs.org]] via emacs.

- spacemacs.org which I plan to write to explain why I'm interested in
  spacemacs and how I use it.

- python.org which I plan to write sometime soon.

*How to read*

Unfortunately the documents are not presented correctly when viewed via URLs
starting with =http://github.com=. For example if [[file:emacs.org][emacs.org]] is viewed via github,
all the /info/ links are not translated into HTML links. Also [[file:emacs.html][emacs.html]] is
displayed by github as raw html rather than rendering it.

Thus I suggest that you read these documents by downloading them first via

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
cd /SOME/DIR
git clone https://github.com/emacs18/notes
#+END_EXAMPLE

then reading [[file:emacs.org]] using emacs or pointing your web browser to
=file:///SOME/DIR/notes/emacs.html=.
