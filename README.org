This is a collection of notes on various topics of my interest such as emacs,
python, etc.

I share this hoping to benefit my friends and colleagues to learn and benefit 
from these wonderful tools.

Documents include

- [[emacs.org]] was created on github in April 2016 cut and pasted from my old notes.
  I plan on adding many other sections over the next few months.

- spacemacs.org which I plan to write to explain why I'm interested in
  spacemacs and how I use spacemacs.

- python.org which I plan to write sometime soon.
